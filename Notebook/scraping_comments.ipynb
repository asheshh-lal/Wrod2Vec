      "hi, nice video as always. However, this is not working for me. I am using Microsoft 365/Desktop version and every time I try to do this I get only one cell with the word picture in it. Could you kindly suggest what might be the cause of this? For your information, I have added all the pictures in the cell with the &quot;picture in cell&quot; option from the ribbon. Thank you.\n",
      "wow this is exactly we need for our project , thanks a lot for sharing Ms Leila ❤❤❤\n",
      "Hey Leila, thanks for all the tips! I am wondering do you have a video to show a simple scenario, when we create a pivot table, we want to attach additional columns of info from our original data sheet as companion info without making those data as computational (as we don&#39;t need it) or it will just expand into so many columns that is not useful. Appreciate your kind advice as run into such common needs very often. Now i need to use V/Xlookup to map the data column manually to maintain my overall readability of my pivoted details. Thanks~!\n",
      "All these options in insert are not coming in my Excel\n",
      "I materials had code if i want both displayed in same row and adjusent column, against each other\n",
      "About time excel got with the picture. But first thing I tried was a use in power query, sadly this seems not yet ready for prime time.  DataFormat.Error: Invalid cell value &#39;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23value\">#VALUE</a>!&#39;. What a shame, gI uess need to wait to join all my data. (tears in the eyes). But appreciate the heads up on this feature it will be a game changer for dull lifless tables full of SKU&#39;s or partnumbers when the world is a visual beast.\n",

      "As always, great presentation 🙂 Works for me in the Table itself, but not in the Pivot afterwords 😞 ?\n",

      "Love that you can now insert pictures into cells but I&#39;d love it even more if it would be possible to dynamically get them from the web via a link referenced somewhere else in the file. This would open up so many possiblities for me.\n",
      "Awesome 👏. I have a question. Can I create a flow using power automate to check my emails for data requests sent to teams, extract, and list them in an excel sheet. The idea is to create a tracker sheet to track requests, dates requested and received. Is that possible or it’s a wild idea? Thanks in advance.\n",

      "Hi Leila, love the show! Thank you for all the wonderful tips.. I&#39;m writing because I,&#39;ve noticed that lately my pivot tables won&#39;t give a row total but it will give me a column total. I&#39;ve try it from scratch, toggling the ON for rows and columns and nothing. I&#39;ve even opened a Microsoft support ticket and nobody can tell me why. Could you help?\n",
      "In my Excel, I can find the Data &gt; Data Types and find country-related information. The step I am stuck in is the part that goes on Insert &gt; Picture &gt; &quot;Place in Cell&quot;, the latter option simply doesn&#39;t exist in my Excel version. Does anyone know what can be the reason and how to activate it? Thanks in advance! :)\n",
